  * Unknown - from <https://forum.pdpatchrepo.info/topic/1028/synthetic-thunder> , this was not evaluated.
Not provided, but still evaluated, is the thunder model from Selfridge. This is part of Nemisindo and too much effort to decouple from the overall system. It can be tried out at <https://nemisindo.com/app/main-panel/thunder.html>
* Data - Original data and spreadsheets used to generate figures. The comments in evaluation were not used in the paper
* Paper - the paper and presentation
